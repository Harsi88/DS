Instructions: 

   We are uploading 6 files contains test cases 0 to 5. The files are contained in the tar 
   archive "input-assgn3.tar.gz".
   
   For example, to run your program on test case 3, run the following command on your terminal:
  
   ./a.out <in3

   I am assuming that the name of your executable is "a.out".
 
   The "<" operator in Linux takes the input for a program from the filename specified after it,
   instead of taking input from the keyboard.
              

0. Insert 1000 random numbers into tree T0, and then find the median.

   Input File: in0
 
   Output:
	4892

1. Insert 1000 numbers into tree T0, delete half the numbers, and find the median of the resulting tree.

   Input File: in1

   Output:
	9663

2. Insert 1000 random numbers into tree T0 between 0 and 30000. Split tree T0 about 20000 to get two trees
   T1 and T2. Split tree T1 about 10000 to get two trees T3 and T4. As a check, find the 50th, 51st, and 52nd
   element in trees T2, T3, and T4, respectively.

   Output:

3. Uses three-way join to make a red-black tree containing 999 integers, assuming they are given
   in sorted order. First make two singleton trees containing the 1st and 3rd elements and join them into a 
   single tree T using the 2nd element. Then make a singleton tree containing the 5th element and joins it with 
   the above tree T using the 4th element. Repeat this process, adding elements in pairs, till we get a tree containing 
   all 999 elements. To check that it works, find the median of the resulting tree.

   Input File: in3

   Output:
	24726

4. Make 16 trees T0-T15, with the $i$th tree having 1000 keys between (i-1)*10000+1 and i*10000-1.
   Merge them recursively using three-way join into a single tree T30 with 16,000 keys. Ask for 
   the 7367th smallest key in this tree.

   Input File: in4

   Output:
	73770

5. Make a single tree T0 containing 2000 keys between 0 and 80000. Splits T0 about
   40000 into T1 and T2. Recursively split T1 about 20000 into T3 and T4, and
   T2 about 60000 into T5 and T6. Split T3 about 10000 into T7 and T8, T4 about
   30000 into T9 and T10, T5 about 50000 into T11 and T12, and T6 about 70000 into
   T13 and T14. 

   To check that everything is correct, finds the 50th smallest element in each of
   trees T7-T14.
